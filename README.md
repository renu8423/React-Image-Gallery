* Pagination: Navigate through the image collection using Prev and Next buttons.
* Loading State: Shows a loading message while images are being fetched.
* Error Handling: Displays an error message if the image fetch fails or no images are found.
* Reusable Image Component: Uses a separate Image component to render each image.
